            <p>After completing my associate's degree from Bryan University my goal is to work as a web developer for a small to medium sized company. I do not have a specific company in mind yet. I will more so be looking for the right environment and atmosphere. I want to work with people who are positive, helpful and constructive. I also would love to have the opportunity to work remotely. While doing this I also plan to do some freelance work. My main focus after graduating will be to gain as much experience as possible in web development.</p>

            <p>In order to build on my current skills I plan to practice as much as possible. I will take every opportunity to work on my web development skills, for example choosing to do this assignment as a website. Each time, trying to do better than the last.</p>

            <p>I enjoyed working on media queries the most. As much as I did (and still sometimes do) struggle with it I believe it makes the website so much more useful. It is also very gratifying when all of the media queries come together and work smoothly. Media queries also require you to focus on each element so it allows me to practice every aspect more.</p>

            <p>My biggest accomplishment in this course was completing the capstone project. It was really gratifying to use all of the skills I learned in the course for one final product.</p>

            <p>I have gained insight into my work ethic and mindset. The 'old me' would have hit the roadblocks and given up but I am learning to embrace a growth mindset. Instead of running from challenges I am working through them. Grit!</p>

            <p>The information I have learned from this course applies directly to my future goals of being a web developer. I have learned the basics of HTML and CSS. Now it's time to build further upon the basics so I can get even closer to my goal. </p>
